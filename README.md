# Teckenskrift

*Teckenskrift* (or *STSwrite* in English) is a writing system for Swedish Sign
Language. It differs from the [STS transcription system] used by sign language
researchers in that it is simpler in structure and easier to read and write.
Much of this ease-of-use comes form taking advantage of the two dimensional
writing surface to portray motion.

STSwrite is very similar to ASLwrite with only some minor adaptions made for
Swedish Sign Language. [ASLwrite], in turn, is a writing system developed for
American Sign Language by Adrean Clark, Jules Dameron, Robert Arnold and many
others.

This repository contains an introduction to STSwrite, plus assorted notes
collected during my attempts to understand all the various aspects of ASLwrite.

Since my writings on STSwrite are primarily indended for a Swedish audience
(more specifically users of Swedish Sign Language) everything here is written
in Swedish. Stuff of a more technical nature (like code, this README and commit
messages, etc) are written in English to make them accessible to my secondary
audience (international sign language researchers and hackers).

## About Me

I'm [zrajm], a (hearing) student of sign language linguistics at Stockholm
University. STSwrite grew out of my frustration with not being able to write
sign language directly. (I wanted to be able to later look up an unrecognized
sign, or to write down new signs enocuntered during lectures.)

My other sign language related projects can be found on my [web page] or
through my [GitHub page].
