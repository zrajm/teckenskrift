# Teckenskrift

*Teckenskrift* (or SSLWrite) is a writing system for Swedish Sign Language. It
differs from the [SSL transcription system] used by sign language researchers
in that it is simpler in structure and easier to read and write. Much of this
ease-of-use comes form taking advantage of the two dimensional writing surface
to portray motion.

SSLWrite is very similar to ASLWrite with only some minor adaptions made for
Swedish Sign Language. [ASLWrite], in turn, is a writing system developed for
American Sign Language by Adrean Clark, Jules Dameron, Robert Arnold and many
others.

## About Me

I'm [zrajm], a (hearing) student of sign language linguistics at Stockholm
University. SSLWrite grew out of my frustration with not being able to write
sign language directly. (I wanted to be able to later look up an unrecognized
sign, or to write down new signs enocuntered during lectures.)

My other sign language related projects can be found on my [web page] or via my
[GitHub page].
