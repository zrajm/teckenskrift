* index: Introduction
** TODO Include a good-looking example high up on the page
** TODO Fingerspelling 'Y' should be more similar to ASLwrite's 'J'
   In Clark's [clark-2017-aslwrite_summary_3.pdf] the 'J' is written by with a
   'lying down' pinky digit, indicating the final position of the hand.
   However, I wrote Swedish 'Y' using the initial hand position -- change to
   indicate the final position.
** TODO Better indication that the videos are videos
   When stopped the video should have a small play symbol in a circle to
   indicate that these are videos which can be played, and not just static
   images. This little video symbol should be placed bottom left (and NOT in
   the center of image, as that will obscure significant parts of the video
   preview).
** TODO Add better feedback when playing videos
   There should be a play pause icon appearing when starting/stopping the video
   (just like there is in the lexicon).
** TODO Describe the edge diacritic better
   The edge diacritic (in the 'Fingrar' chapter) is not described very well.
   Describe how it work in neutral space.

   Also give concrete example of how to use it in combination with body
   positions?

   Some signs that could benefit from this:

** TODO Reorder and/or recategorize handshapes

   For example relative clauses, interrogative sentences, rhetorical questions,
   statements

    Swedish and sign language.
*** TODO Title of article in sign language
** TODO Rename 'mötande linjer'?
   Should these be called 'ihopgående' or 'sammangående', to parallel
   'isärgående linjer'?
* [/] Do a little relationship tree of different *SLwrite
  Si5s, Si5s v2, BSLwrite, JSLwrite, STSwrite etc.
* [/] Add sort order page
* [/] Handshape name page with international terminology
  The problem with the current handshape terminology is that it differs to much
  between languages and thus is hard to translate. Handshape names should be
  directly translatable from language to language, and thus should:

  + NOT be based on fingerspelling names of handshapes (these differs too much
    between languages).
  + Should use accepted terms as far as possible (i.e. borrow terms from others
    such as HamNoSys, Typannot, or SignWriting?)
  + Maybe use medical terminology for thumb position?
  + Have clear and unambiguous terms (i.e. if a term has been sloppily used
    historically, we should probably avoid it, or, [second best] defined it
    precisely).

  This should use terms from Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon as far as possible,
  but also deviate from that when needed. (See
  https://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/verktyg/utskrift and
  https://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/lage.)

  These concepts are good (but words might have to change):

   + 'utsträkt/rak', 'vinklad', 'böjd'
     HamNoSys: 'extended', 'flattened' and 'bent' (HamNoSys also has 'hooked'
     indicating fingers are more bent than 'bent', e.g. in ASL 'E' handshape --
     do not occur in Swedish?)

   + 'spretad' & 'samlad'
     HamNoSys: 'spread' & 'nonspread'

   + 'stor' (all secondary fingers straight)
     HamNoSys: 'others extended' (and 'other extended spread')

   + 'liten' (only index and middle finger doing a thing 'liten o-hand')
     HamNoSys: 'two fingers'

   + 'baby' (only index finger doing a thing, 'baby o-hand')
     HamNoSys: 'one finger'

  Note that 'stor' and 'liten' (which are opposite adjectives in Swedish in
  general) not are opposites in this context. Maybe rename these? (e.g. 'stor
  liten o-hand' makes perfect sense).

  + The word 'finger' does not include the thumb.
  + One-finger handshapes should be 'thumb', 'index finger', 'pinky' and so
    on.
  + Index finger is the 'primary finger', so if a handshape name is just a
    number of fingers we start with the index finger and count towards the
    pinky:

    - 'one finger' = index finger (HamNoSys uses this),
    - 'two fingers' = index and middle finger,
    - 'three fingers' = index, middle and ring finger.

  (Maybe see http://zrajm.github.devel/teckentranskription/NEWER/handform.html?)

* [0/0] Add non-translate attributes to transcriptions
  Apparently at least some of my pages look like shite if run through google
  translate. Maybe this can make, for example, the font table in freesans-swl
  look good even after translation?
* [0/8] Translate all notes into English
  The main page should remain in Swedish, but all notes should be in English
  (for the benefit of an international audience). Link files from old to new
  names. ('index.html' should remain in Swedish.

  Also, rename files to English titles, and add forwards from old to new page
  URL.

   Display a graph of the various handshapes pictures and their digits. Include
   a selector of which version to use (Arnold 2007, Clark 2013, Clark 2023,
   STSwrite etc.).

   The point is to cluster thing by property and see how they lump together,
   and if the lumping of the digit properties is similar to that of the
   handshapes themselves.
** TODO Marking when orientation of digit & hand does not match
   This could be solved by having each hand photographed from both sides, and a
   symbol illustrating each of these hand positions. I.e. a photo of a Swedish
   E handshape from the palm side, and one from back of the hand (where thumb
   position isn't visible), each illustrated with separate E hand digit.

   There are several digits for which the orientation between the digit and its
   illustration differ. These should *at least* be marked in the table. When
   fixing this, also rewrite/remove the paragraph of text about this (a ‘Note:’
   just before the table itself).

   Examples are:
   + American E /KFFFF/
   + American open E /kffff/
   + bent thumb /(r)-kkkk/
   + Swedish M-hand/K-rrr-K/

   Ideally this should be fixed by reorienting the illustration and/or the
   digit?
