* index: Introduction
** TODO Fingerspelling 'Y' should be more similar to ASLwrite's 'J'
   In Clark's [clark-2017-aslwrite_summary_3.pdf] the 'J' is written by with a
   'lying down' pinky digit, indicating the final position of the hand.
   However, I wrote Swedish 'Y' using the initial hand position -- change to
   indicate the final position.
** TODO Better indication that the videos are videos
   When stopped the video should have a small play symbol in a circle to
   indicate that these are videos which can be played, and not just static
   images. This little video symbol should be placed bottom left (and NOT in
   the center of image, as that will obscure significant parts of the video
   preview).
** TODO Add better feedback when playing videos
   There should be a play pause icon appearing when starting/stopping the video
   (just like there is in the lexicon).
** TODO Describe the edge diacritic better
   The edge diacritic (in the 'Fingrar' chapter) is not described very well.
   Describe how it work in neutral space.

   Also give concrete example of how to use it in combination with body
   positions?

   Some signs that could benefit from this:

   (maybe ’fingerformer’?)
** TODO Add example of combined eyebrows/mouth and nose wrinkle
   http://www.aslwrite.com/writeaslnow/extramanualmarks/
** TODO Reorder and/or recategorize handshapes
   Maybe order by frequency of occurrence, based on corpus data?
** TODO Add more fingerspelling examples
** TODO Add sentence examples
   (from Bergman's grammatical compendium?)

   For example relative clauses, interrogative sentences, rhetorical questions,
   statements

    Name of cities (Stockholm + Uppsala, maybe?) photoshopped with text both in
    Swedish and sign language.
*** TODO Title of article in sign language
** TODO Rename 'mötande linjer'?
   Should these be called 'ihopgående' or 'sammangående', to parallel
   'isärgående linjer'?
* [0/8] Translate all notes into English
  The main page should remain in Swedish, but all notes should be in English
  (for the benefit of an international audience). Link files from old to new
  names. ('index.html' should remain in Swedish.

  Also, rename files to English titles, and add forwards from old to new page
  URL.

** TODO Marking when orientation of digit & hand does not match
   There are several digits for which the orientation between the digit and its
   illustration differ. These should *at least* be marked in the table. When
   fixing this, also rewrite/remove the paragraph of text about this (a ‘Note:’
   just before the table itself).

   Examples are:
   + American E /KFFFF/
   + American open E /kffff/
   + bent thumb /(r)-kkkk/
   + Swedish M-hand/K-rrr-K/

   Ideally this should be fixed by reorienting the illustration and/or the
   digit?
** TODO Ge klohand ett extra fingerstreck?
   Klohand har bara ett extra fingerstreck, medan böjd 4-hand har två (för att
   distingera den från böjd W-hand). Kolla hur det ser ut i ASLwrite. Vad är
   rimligt i STS-skrift?

** TODO F-hand's symbol should be more consistent with stor nyphand
   F-hand /RFrrr/ and stor nyphand /B-B-rrr/
** TODO Add footnote on difference in flat and rounded O-hand
   There's not so much difference between flat and bent O-hand in ASL, while in
   STS it's an important distinction -- this affects the symbols of all the
   'large' handshapes (U-hand, stor nyphand /B-B-r-r-r/ och /V-V-r-r-r/).

     /v-rr-kk/ (N-måtthand, liten tumvinkelhand) and /V-VV-kk/ (liten O-hand).
** TODO Add si5s (Arnold v2) to table
** TODO Add Tanada 3D-hand digit to table
   Is this digit only included in Tanada version 1? If so add version 1 to the
   reference (and link to it), and also add footnote about this.
** TODO Create & use consistent handshape terminology (for Swedish and English)
   This should use terms from Svenskt teckenspråkslexikon as far as possible,
   but also deviate from that when needed. (See
   https://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/verktyg/utskrift and
   https://teckensprakslexikon.su.se/lage.)

   The terms should NOT be based on fingerspelling (i.e. not use the
   fingerspelling alphabet for inspiration of names), and should have names
   that are have direct translations between Swedish and English.

   Should rely on medical terminology for thumb positions, maybe?

   These concepts are good (but words might have to change):

   + 'spretad'/'samlad'
   + 'stor' (all secondary fingers straight)
   + 'liten' (only index and long finger doing a thing 'liten o-hand')
   + 'baby' (only index finger doing a thing, 'baby o-hand')

   Note that 'stor' and 'liten' (which are opposite adjectives in Swedish in
   general) not are opposites in this context. Maybe rename these? (e.g. 'stor
   liten o-hand' makes perfect sense).

   Handshapes with one finger as the primary finger should be named after the
   finger ('thumb', 'index finger', 'pinky' and so on).

* [0/10] munbild: Mouth segment notes
** TODO Look at mouthings in described in SSLC
   The Swedish Sign Language Corpus have at least some annotations of reduced
   mouthings borrowed from Swedish. -- I happened to stumble upon the
   annotation '(t)i(ll)ä(gga);tillägga' (in tier 'Kommentar_mun S2' in file

   single source that describes them both with pictures, but one adverb
   (“‘normally’, ‘with ease’”) is described in ”A Preliminary Analysis of
   Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign Language” as not being among the mouth
   segments there described – which the other realization of [m] looks like
