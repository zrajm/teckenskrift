* SSLWrite article
** Mouth segment article
*** Clean up references section
    Write each reference in an appropriate form.
*** Add pics from How to Write American Sign Language
*** Add oral adverb pics from Teckenspråks – Så klart! videos
*** Clear up confusion of the two oral adverbs [m]
    Are they the same with two different realisations? (I have yet to find a
    single source that describes them both with pictures, but one adverb
    (“‘normally’, ‘with ease’”) is described in ”A Preliminary Analysis of
    Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign Language” as not being among the
    mouth segments there described – which the other realization of [m] looks
    like what they there describe as /bilabial/.
*** Add [ɧ], [ɕ] and [ŋ] (“Svenska munbilder” section)
*** Give SSLWrite symbol to all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
*** Categorize all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
*** Compare “Svenska munbilder” section with someone else's work
    Have we drawn similar conclusions? Categorized the same mouth shapes as
    similar?
*** Collect data/write rules for how to produce borrowed mouthings
    Useful data can be found in:
    * ”A Preliminary Analysis of Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign
      Language” has a bunch of useful examples of reductions.
