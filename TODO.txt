* Mouth segment article
** TODO Clean up references section
   Write each reference in an appropriate form.
** TODO Add pics from "How to Write American Sign Language"
** TODO Add oral adverb pics from Teckenspråks – Så klart! videos
** TODO Clear up confusion of the two oral adverbs [m]
   Are they the same with two different realisations? (I have yet to find a
   single source that describes them both with pictures, but one adverb
   (“‘normally’, ‘with ease’”) is described in ”A Preliminary Analysis of
   Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign Language” as not being among the mouth
   segments there described – which the other realization of [m] looks like
   what they there describe as /bilabial/.
** TODO Add [ɧ], [ɕ] and [ŋ] (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Give SSLWrite symbol to all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Categorize all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Compare “Svenska munbilder” section with someone else's work
   Have we drawn similar conclusions? Categorized the same mouth shapes as
   similar?
** TODO Collect data/write rules for how to produce borrowed mouthings
   Useful data can be found in:
   * ”A Preliminary Analysis of Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign
     Language” has a bunch of useful examples of reductions.
