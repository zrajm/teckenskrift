* index: Introduction
** TODO Better indication that the videos are videos
   When stopped the video should have a small play symbol in a circle to
   indicate that these are videos which can be played, and not just static
   images. This little video symbol should be placed bottom left (and NOT in
   the center of image, as that will obscure significant parts of the video
   preview).
** TODO Add better feedback when playing videos
   There should be a play pause icon appearing when starting/stopping the video
   (just like there is in the lexicon).
** TODO Describe the edge diacritic better
   The edge diacritic (in the 'Fingrar' chapter) is not described very well.
   Describe how it work in neutral space.

   Also give concrete example of how to use it in combination with body
   positions?

   Some signs that could benefit from this:

** TODO Better Swedish translation of ’digibet’
   (maybe ’fingerformer’?)
** TODO Add example of combined eyebrows/mouth and nose wrinkle
   http://www.aslwrite.com/writeaslnow/extramanualmarks/
** TODO Reorder and/or recategorize handshapes
   Maybe order by frequency of occurrence, based on corpus data?
** TODO Add more fingerspelling examples
** TODO Add sentence examples
   (from Bergman's grammatical compendium?)

   For example relative clauses, interrogative sentences, rhetorical questions,
   statements

   'If' sentence: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155275501528404
** TODO Look through Niks list of handshapes, see that they're all included
** TODO Add brief comment on design principles of handshape symbols
   http://www.aslwrite.com/whats-secret-asl-digits-2/
** TODO Examples with vertical marker on expanding/contracting motion lines
** [0/2] Writing example in text introduction
*** TODO Street sign mockup (in Swedish + SSL)
    Name of cities (Stockholm + Uppsala, maybe?) photoshopped with text both in
    Swedish and sign language.
*** TODO Title of article in sign language
** TODO Rename 'mötande linjer'?
   Should these be called 'ihopgående' or 'sammangående', to parallel
   'isärgående linjer'?
* anteckningar
* aslwrite
* handsymboler
** TODO Ge klohand ett extra fingerstreck?
   Klohand har bara ett extra fingerstreck, medan böjd 4-hand har två (för att
   distingera den från böjd W-hand). Kolla hur det ser ut i ASLwrite. Vad är
   rimligt i STS-skrift?
* munbild: Mouth segment notes
** TODO Look at mouthings in described in SSLC
   The Swedish Sign Language Corpus have at least some annotations of reduced
   mouthings borrowed from Swedish. -- I happened to stumble upon the
   annotation '(t)i(ll)ä(gga);tillägga' (in tier 'Kommentar_mun S2' in file
   'sslc01_003.eaf') -- maybe there are more to be found?

   Could this data help in cataloging all the mouthings borrowed from Swedish?
** TODO Clean up references section
   Write each reference in an appropriate form.
** TODO Add pics from "How to Write American Sign Language"
** TODO Add oral adverb pics from Teckenspråks – Så klart! videos
** TODO Clear up confusion of the two oral adverbs [m]
   Are they the same with two different realisations? (I have yet to find a
   single source that describes them both with pictures, but one adverb
   (“‘normally’, ‘with ease’”) is described in ”A Preliminary Analysis of
   Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign Language” as not being among the mouth
   segments there described – which the other realization of [m] looks like
   what they there describe as /bilabial/.
** TODO Add [ɧ], [ɕ] and [ŋ] (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Give STSwrite symbol to all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Categorize all mouth segments (“Svenska munbilder” section)
** TODO Compare “Svenska munbilder” section with someone else's work
   Have we drawn similar conclusions? Categorized the same mouth shapes as
   similar?
** TODO Collect data/write rules for how to produce borrowed mouthings
   Useful data can be found in:
   * ”A Preliminary Analysis of Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign
     Language” has a bunch of useful examples of reductions.
* negation
* skriftsystem
* Finished
** DONE Updated jQuery version and added source map
   CLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 16:01]
   The source map requires both jquery-3.7.1.slim.min.map and the unminified
   jquery-3.7.1.slim.js to be present, as well as the line:

       //# sourceMappingURL=jquery-3.7.1.slim.min.map

   To be added to the end of the minified jQuery file. (The map and unminified
   files are only ever loaded when debug tools are used in the browser, not
   during normal web page loading.)
** DONE Use GPLv2 instead of GPLv3
   CLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 15:22]
   Also updated all mentions of licenses to make sure they include both CC and
   GPL licenses.
** DONE Change favicon to STSwrite handshape
   CLOSED: [2023-09-12 Tue 15:00]
** DONE Add pictures of hands above example ’fingerbetet’
   CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Mon 16:00]
** DONE Remove 'strömarkör'
   CLOSED: [2019-04-07 Sun 03:11]
   Use 'fladdermarkör' (flutter marker) instead. Flutter marker + handshape
   with contact between thumb and fingers (ie a-hand, o-hand, nyphand och liten
   o-hand) = strö. Flutter marker + handshape without contact = flutter.
** DONE Remove 'böjsmarkör' och 'skakmarkör'
   CLOSED: [2019-04-07 Sun 01:30]
   These can be covered by 'vinkmarkör' placed in different places relative to
   the handshape.
** DONE Rename 'skiljande linjer' -> 'isärgående linjer'
   CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Mon 21:00]
   Call them 'isärgående linjer' instead. (Since 'skiljande linje' could mean
   either 'a line that cuts into two' or 'a line that diverge' -- better to
   eliminate that ambiguity.)
** DONE Linked to `all-lips.svg` image from munbilder.html
   CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Mon 16:06]
   Full filename is `teckenskrift/pic/mun/all-lips.svg`.
** DONE Add videos to word/sentence examples
   CLOSED: [2019-02-25 Mon 15:59]
** DONE Stop using 'SSL-skrift' only call it 'Teckenskrift'
   CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 15:24]
** DONE Add README.md
   CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 14:41]
** DONE Copy this TODO list to the one in the repo
   CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 00:00]
** DONE Multiple licenses?
   CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 17:26]
   Code should be released under GNU, but other text under Creative Commons.
** DONE Move TODO comments in 'index.html' to this file
   CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 22:45]
** [8/8] Move STSwrite into its own git repo
*** DONE Add GitHub pages redirects from old places to new
    CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 04:31]
    Redirect using HTTP refresh?
    <meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.domain.com/newlocation">
*** DONE Remove files for this project project from its earlier repo
    CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 04:31]
*** DONE Update links in all other pages to new place
    CLOSED: [2019-02-24 Sun 02:51]
    There are none. The only link found is the one on zrajm.github.io.
*** DONE Update links from zrajm.github.io to new place
    CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 18:24]
*** DONE Add repo description on GitHub
    CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 17:23]
*** DONE Publish repo on GitHub Pages
    CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 17:23]
*** DONE Add new repo to GitHub
    CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 15:15]
*** DONE Cleanup last commit (unmove stuff into subdir).
    CLOSED: [2019-02-23 Sat 13:48]
*** DONE Cleanup TODO file history
    CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 19:14]
    Remove everything from TODO.txt that's other projects.
*** DONE Rewrite all commit messages
    CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:41]
**** DONE Remove mentions of project name
     CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:40]
     Basically every commit message mentions which project it belongs to, this
     is redundant when the project gets its own repo.
**** DONE Also remove trailing periods.
     CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:38]
     All commit messages ends in a period, but this is not best practice so
     let's undo that since we're rewriting history anyway.
