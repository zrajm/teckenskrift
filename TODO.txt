** TODO Add oral adverb pics from Teckenspråks – Så klart! videos
** TODO Clear up confusion of the two oral adverbs [m]
   Are they the same with two different realisations? (I have yet to find a
   single source that describes them both with pictures, but one adverb
   (“‘normally’, ‘with ease’”) is described in ”A Preliminary Analysis of
   Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign Language” as not being among the mouth
   segments there described – which the other realization of [m] looks like
   what they there describe as /bilabial/.

   similar?

   Useful data can be found in:
   * ”A Preliminary Analysis of Visual Mouth Segments in Swedish Sign
     Language” has a bunch of useful examples of reductions.
* negation

*** DONE Rewrite all commit messages
    CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:41]
**** DONE Remove mentions of project name
     CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:40]
     Basically every commit message mentions which project it belongs to, this
     is redundant when the project gets its own repo.
**** DONE Also remove trailing periods.
     CLOSED: [2019-02-22 Fri 18:38]
     All commit messages ends in a period, but this is not best practice so
     let's undo that since we're rewriting history anyway.
